Era of Chaos
================================================================================

The Era of Chaos is a custom era for the game [Battle for Wesnoth] [1].
It is based on the campaigns Under the Burning Suns, Invasion from the Unknown, 
and After the Storm, as well as some custom factions made by Espreon and myself. 
It also features extended mainline factions with a greater variety of units.
